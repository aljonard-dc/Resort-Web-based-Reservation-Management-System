## Project Description
The system offers an intuitive and user-friendly website that provides comprehensive information about the resort, a seamless and efficient reservation management system, and an engaging virtual tour of the resort. It was developed to modernize the reservation process, transitioning from a manual system to a fully automated one, ensuring greater efficiency and accuracy. Additionally, the system aims to enhance the overall quality of service and boost customer satisfaction, creating a more enjoyable and hassle-free experience for guests

## Project Structure
The project is organized into the following directories:

- **CSS**: Contains the stylesheet files for the website.
- **PHP**: Includes any backend PHP scripts used (if any).
- **Resources**: Holds images, icons, and other media resources.
- **SQL**: Contains any SQL scripts used for database setup.

## Features
- **Promotional Website**: The website features a gallery showcasing the resort’s offerings, including images of rooms, the swimming pool, parking lot, function hall, resort amenities, green spaces, seasonal fruits, and event setups. This allows users to get a visual preview of what the resort has to offer.

- **GCash and PayPal Payment**: The reservation management system integrates online payment options, offering users the convenience of choosing between GCash and PayPal. Users can opt to make a half-payment as a down payment or pay the full price for their reservation. This feature streamlines the booking process by providing flexible and secure payment choices. By catering to diverse preferences, this payment integration enhances the accessibility and user-friendliness of the reservation system, ensuring a seamless and accommodating transaction experience.

Users will receive email notifications sent to the address they provide for various actions, such as reservation confirmations, cancellations, and account verification during registration. This ensures prompt and reliable communication at every stage of their interaction.

- **QR Code**: Upon completing a reservation, the system generates a unique QR code for download. This QR code serves as proof of booking and is required during check-in. It includes essential details such as the client’s information, tour package, number of guests, check-in and check-out times, room details, and total rate, which can be quickly accessed when scanned.
